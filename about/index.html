<h1>About</h1>
<p class = "lead">
    Hi, I'm Andrey. A second year Web and Information Systems major at NJIT.
</p>
<p>
   The high school I went to is the Academy of Allied Health and Science in Neptune, NJ. It's kind of funny how the school set me up to go into medicine but instead, I opted to go the tech route.
Even though I'm not pursuing a degree in biology or nursing, that doesn't change the fact that I'm still passionate about both tech and medicine and I hope I can find a career that merges both of the fields. Even though I'm not a web dev expert, I'm excited to learn
all the skills and programming languages that would allow me to do so. No one ever accidentally becomes successful which means I'm willing to put in the work to do that!
<p>
Serious stuff aside, I'm a very interesting guy with so many hobbies. I have invested countless hours into Super Smash Bros Ultimate and I also enjoy eating snacks and catching up with the latest memes on Reddit.
